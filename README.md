# Image processing using Intel's DAAL vs. OpenMP

### Introduction:

In this project we will be comparing Intel's Data Analytics Acceleration Library and OpenMP API to Optimizing Image Processing using Parallel computing and Vectorization. We designed three tasks fot this project Image Sharpening, brightness and Color Saturation. For each task the performance of both Libraries is recorded and compared in the main file.

## Appendix

### Data Analytics Acceleration Library Overview:

Intel's Data Analytics Library offers a robust collection of tools and algorithms that can assist programmers in building high-performance applications tailored for Intel chips. Data Analytics Library offers functionalities for:

- Parallel computing.
- Vectorization.
- Machine learning.
- Graph analytics.
- etc.

### OpenMP API Overview:

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a robust API for multi-platform shared-memory multi-processing programming in C and C++. It provides developers with compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables to use when writing parallel programs that can run on multiple processor cores. Some of the functionalities provided by OpenMP are as follows:

- Parallel computing
- Vectorization
- Thread management
- Memory management
- Loop scheduling
- etc.
